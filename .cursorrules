## Code Style and Quality Standards

### General Principles
- Write concise, readable TypeScript code with comprehensive type safety  
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns  
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and SOLID principles  
- Implement early returns and guard clauses for better readability  
- Structure code logically: exports first, then components, helpers, and types  
- Prioritize performance and accessibility in all implementations  

### Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive, intention-revealing names  
- Prefix boolean variables with auxiliary verbs (`isLoading`, `hasError`, `canEdit`)  
- Prefix event handlers with "handle" (`handleClick`, `handleSubmit`, `handleChange`)  
- Use camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for components and types  
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (`components/ui`, `lib/utils`, `server/api`)  
- Favor named exports over default exports for better refactoring  

### TypeScript Best Practices
- Use TypeScript in strict mode for maximum type safety  
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes  
- Use union types and const assertions instead of enums  
- Implement proper type guards and narrowing  
- Use the `satisfies` operator for type validation  
- Create comprehensive type definitions for all data structures  
- Leverage Prisma's generated types for database operations  

## React 19 and Next.js 15 Guidelines

### Component Architecture
- Favor React Server Components (RSC) for data fetching and static content  
- Use `'use client'` directive sparingly, only when necessary for interactivity  
- Implement proper error boundaries for robust error handling  
- Use Suspense for async operations and loading states  
- Optimize for Core Web Vitals and performance metrics  
- Follow the composition pattern over inheritance  

### Modern React Patterns
- Use new React 19 hooks: `useActionState`, `useOptimistic`, `useFormStatus`  
- Implement proper async/await patterns in Server Components  
- Leverage Server Actions for form submissions and mutations  
- Use React Query (TanStack Query) for server state management  
- Keep client-side state minimal and focused  

### State Management Strategy
- Use `useActionState` instead of deprecated `useFormState`  
- Leverage `useFormStatus` for enhanced form handling  
- Implement URL state management with 'nuqs' for persistent state  
- Use React Query (TanStack Query) for server state management  
- Keep client-side state minimal and focused  
- Use Zustand for complex client state when needed  

### Async Request Handling
- Always use async versions of Next.js runtime APIs (`cookies()`, `headers()`, `params`)  
- Handle all async operations with proper error boundaries  
- Implement proper loading states and error handling  
- Use Server Actions for mutations and form submissions  

## Database Design with Prisma

### Schema Best Practices
- Use descriptive model names and consistent field naming  
- Implement proper relationships with foreign keys  
- Use appropriate field types and constraints  
- Add database indexes for frequently queried fields

- Implement proper cascading deletes and updates  

### Database Operations
- Use Prisma client with comprehensive error handling
